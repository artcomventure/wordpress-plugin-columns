  ```
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

## Plugin Updates

Although the plugin is not _yet_ listed on https://wordpress.org/plugins/, you can use WordPress' update functionality to keep it in sync with the files from [GitHub](https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-columns).

**Since 1.4.0 please use for this our [WordPress Repository Updater](https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-repoUpdater)** with the settings:

* Repository URL: https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-columns/
* Subfolder (optionally, if you don't want/need the development files in your environment): build

_We test our plugin through its paces, but we advise you to take all safety precautions before the update. Just in case of the unexpected._
